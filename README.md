This project contains a basic Event Registration Form built using HTML and CSS. The form is designed to collect a user's full name for event registration purposes. It includes simple styling for a clean and minimalistic look, featuring:

A centered form container with padding and a subtle box shadow.

A heading for the form title.

A labeled text input for the full name.

Basic styling for inputs and labels to improve readability.

Note: The form currently includes only the full name input field and does not have a submit button or additional input fields like email or phone number. Also, there are some CSS and HTML syntax errors that need to be fixed for full functionality and proper styling
